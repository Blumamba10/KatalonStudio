   <description>Create a user with Project role = TDES_USERS_ADMIN.

Login with the user and verify: 
>Should only show the Security > Users menu link 
>Should only show the Projects Assignment menu link if they have access to their own projects to share (per share project permissions – existing logic).
>Should be able to edit, delete, add or export Users (all permissions here)
>Should only be able to EDIT/ADD/DELETE Project Roles (separate tab) for Users only if they have the PROJECTS_ASSIGNMENT role too.  Should be read- only here if they don’t have this access.</description>
